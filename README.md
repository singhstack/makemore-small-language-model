# makemore-small-language-model

makemore is a bi-gram based language model that predicts the next best character. Its training data is a list of words (people names) and the model learns the probabilities from the text data.

The various commits to the repo reflect different stages of completion, brevity, modularity and documentation.

Following is an example of the text file used for training the model

```
aeriline
najlah
sherrith
ryel
irmi
taislee
mortaz
akarli
```
